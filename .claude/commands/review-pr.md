## Phase 0: Multi-Agent Peer Review

This review must be run as a three-reviewer peer review rather than a
single-agent review.

### Required Orchestration

1. Do only the minimum parent-side setup needed to compose the reviewer prompt.
   - identify the PR
   - fetch the PR metadata and diff surface once if needed
   - do not perform deep review or serial model-specific analysis yourself yet
2. Launch these three subagents in parallel.
   - In Cursor, use:
     - `pr-review-gemini-3-1-pro`
     - `pr-review-gpt-5-4-high`
     - `pr-review-claude-4-6-opus-high-thinking`
   - In Claude Code, use:
     - `pr-review-haiku`
     - `pr-review-sonnet`
     - `pr-review-opus`
3. Issue all three subagent launches in the same message/tool batch.
   - Do not launch reviewer 1, wait, then reviewer 2, then reviewer 3.
   - Do not do additional parent analysis between the three launches.
   - The launch is only considered parallel if all three subagent `started`
     events occur before the first reviewer completes.
4. Give each subagent the same PR target and the same core review mission:
   - review only the target PR
   - gather evidence with `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh pr checks`, and code inspection
   - focus on bugs, regressions, migration hazards, performance risks, security issues, and missing tests
   - avoid style-only comments unless they point to a real defect
5. Keep the subagents independent. Do not let one subagent's output shape
   another subagent's review.
6. Wait for all three reviewers to finish before producing the final report.
7. Synthesize the findings using the same model family as `pr-review-opus`.
8. Deduplicate overlapping findings and mark consensus for each item as `1/3`,
   `2/3`, or `3/3`.
9. Prefer direct evidence over vote count. If reviewers disagree, inspect the
   code yourself before deciding what belongs in the final report.
10. If a subagent fails to run, say so explicitly and lower confidence in the
   final review.
11. Add a concise reviewer-comparison summary that explains what each reviewer
   emphasized, where they disagreed, and whether the multi-agent review added
   material value over a single strong review.
12. If the reviewers were not launched in a single batch, say that the run
    used degraded concurrency.

## Target Scale Context

**CRITICAL**: This review must consider the target scale:

| Table | Expected Row Count | Impact Level |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| `Manifest` | 100+ million rows | CRITICAL |
| `ManifestBlob` | 100+ million rows | CRITICAL |
| `Tag` | 100+ million rows | CRITICAL |
| `ImageStorage` | 100+ million rows | CRITICAL |
| `User` | Millions of rows | HIGH |
| `Repository` | Millions of rows | HIGH |

**Traffic Pattern**: 98% reads (image pulls), 2% writes (pushes)

---

## Phase 1: Gather PR Information

### Step 1: Fetch PR Details

```bash
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,files,additions,deletions,author,baseRefName,headRefName,state,labels,reviews
```

**Extract and note:**
- Title and description
- Files changed and lines modified
- Base and head branches
- Labels (especially `database-migration`, `performance`, etc.)
- Existing review comments

### Step 2: Get Full Diff

```bash
gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS
```

After the boxed report, add this appendix:

```text
## Reviewer Comparison
- [Reviewer/model 1]: what it emphasized and whether it surfaced anything unique
- [Reviewer/model 2]: what it emphasized and whether it surfaced anything unique
- [Reviewer/model 3]: what it emphasized and whether it surfaced anything unique

## Incremental Value
- Did the multi-agent review materially improve the final result?
- Which findings, if any, were unique to one reviewer?
- Would a single strong reviewer likely have been sufficient for this PR?
```

---

## Phase 2: Classify Changes

Categorize each changed file:

| Category | Path Pattern | Review Focus |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Database Schema** | `data/migrations/versions/*.py` | Migration safety, locking, backfill |
| **Database Models** | `data/model/*.py` | Query patterns, N+1, indexes |
| **API Endpoints** | `endpoints/api/*.py`, `endpoints/v2/*.py` | Request handling, caching |
| **Workers** | `workers/*.py` | Background job scaling |
| **Storage** | `storage/*.py` | I/O patterns, blob handling |
| **Auth** | `auth/*.py` | Security, session handling |
| **Frontend** | `web/src/**` | Components, hooks, API calls |
| **Tests** | `**/test_*.py`, `**/*.test.ts` | Coverage, quality |
| **Config** | `conf/**`, `config.py` | Feature flags, settings |

---

## Phase 3: Database & Performance Analysis

### Step 3: Migration Review (if applicable)

For any files in `data/migrations/versions/`:

**Check for DANGEROUS operations on large tables:**

1. **Table Locks** - Will this lock the table during migration?
   - `ALTER TABLE` with column changes
   - Adding NOT NULL constraints without defaults
   - Changing column types
   - Creating indexes without `CONCURRENTLY`

2. **Backfill Operations** - Does this touch all rows?
   - `UPDATE` statements without batching
   - Data transformations on large tables
   - Population of new columns

3. **Index Creation**
   - Is `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` used for large tables?
   - Will the index creation time be acceptable at scale?

4. **Downgrade Safety**
   - Is `downgrade()` implemented and tested?
   - Can we roll back without data loss?

**Generate severity assessment:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Full table lock on 100M+ row table
- 🟠 **HIGH**: Index creation without CONCURRENTLY on large table
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Backfill without batching strategy
- 🟢 **LOW**: Schema changes on small/new tables

### Step 3a: Alembic Migration Chain Validation

**CRITICAL**: If this PR contains an Alembic migration, verify it won't cause multiple heads.

**Problem**: When multiple PRs with migrations are merged without rebasing, Alembic ends up with multiple head revisions, causing migration failures with errors like:
```
alembic.util.exc.CommandError: Multiple head revisions are present
```

**Validation Steps:**

1. **Extract migration info from PR**:
   - Find the migration file(s) in `data/migrations/versions/`
   - Extract the `revision` and `down_revision` values from each migration

2. **Get current head on base branch**:
   ```bash
   # Get the current alembic head from the base branch (usually master)
   git show origin/master:data/migrations/versions/ | grep -l "^revision = " | head -1
   # Or check the most recent migration file
   ls -t data/migrations/versions/*.py | head -1
   ```

3. **Verify chain integrity**:
   - The PR's `down_revision` MUST match the current head revision on the base branch
   - If it doesn't match, the PR needs to be rebased before merge

4. **Check for conflicts with other open PRs**:
   ```bash
   # List other open PRs that also contain migrations
   gh pr list --state open --json number,title,files --jq '.[] | select(.files[].path | startswith("data/migrations/versions/"))'
   ```

**Report in output:**

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Migration `down_revision` | `[revision_id]` |
| Current base branch head | `[head_revision_id]` |
| Chain Valid | [✅ YES / 🔴 NO - NEEDS REBASE] |
| Other Open Migration PRs | [count] - [PR numbers if any] |

**If chain is invalid (🔴)**:
- This is a **BLOCKING** issue
- The PR author must rebase onto the latest base branch
- Update the `down_revision` to point to the new head
- Re-run migration tests after rebasing

### Step 4: Query Pattern Analysis

For any files in `data/model/` or database-related code:

**Check for performance anti-patterns:**

1. **N+1 Query Problems**
   - Loops that execute queries
   - Missing `joinedload()` or `selectinload()` for relationships
   - Sequential queries that could be batched

2. **Missing Indexes**
   - New `filter()` or `WHERE` clauses on unindexed columns
   - New `ORDER BY` on unindexed columns
   - Queries on Manifest, ManifestBlob, Tag, ImageStorage tables

3. **Full Table Scans**
   - Queries without adequate `WHERE` clauses
   - `LIKE '%pattern%'` searches
   - Functions in WHERE clauses (e.g., `LOWER(column)`)

4. **Transaction Scope**
   - Long-running transactions that hold locks
   - Missing transaction boundaries
   - Transactions that span external calls (HTTP, storage)

5. **Read vs Write Path**
   - Does this affect the read path (98% of traffic)?
   - Is there appropriate read replica usage?
   - Are writes optimized for low frequency?

### Step 5: API Performance Review

For any files in `endpoints/`:

**Check for:**

1. **Request Handling**
   - Response time impact estimation
   - Pagination for list endpoints
   - Appropriate use of caching headers

2. **External Service Calls**
   - Calls to Clair, storage backends, external auth
   - Missing timeouts
   - Missing circuit breakers
   - Synchronous calls that could be async

3. **Caching**
   - Is Redis caching used where appropriate?
   - Cache invalidation correctness
   - Cache key collision potential

### Step 6: Frontend API Call Analysis

For frontend changes (`web/src/`):

**Check for:**

1. **Excessive API Calls**
   - Multiple calls that could be combined
   - Missing debouncing on search/filter
   - Polling frequency concerns

2. **Client-Side Joins**
   - Multiple sequential API calls for related data
   - Data that should come from a single endpoint

### Step 7: Worker & Storage Impact

For any files in `workers/` or `storage/`:

**Check for:**

1. **Job Volume**
   - Will this generate jobs proportional to table size?
   - Is there rate limiting?
   - Queue size implications

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Memory consumption patterns
   - CPU-intensive operations
   - Storage I/O patterns

3. **Blob Operations**
   - Large blob handling (streaming vs buffering)
   - Connection pooling
   - Retry behavior

## Review Guidelines

### Approve (✅) when:
- No critical issues found
- Code is clean and follows best practices
- Performance impact is acceptable at 100M+ row scale
- Migrations are safe for production
- Test coverage is adequate
- Architecture is sound
- Python code is idiomatic and well-structured
- React/TS code follows best practices

### Approve with Comments (⚠️) when:
- Minor improvements possible but not blocking
- Code works but could be cleaner
- Documentation could be enhanced
- Additional tests recommended but not required
- Minor Pythonic or React pattern improvements suggested

### Request Changes (🔄) when:
- Performance issues identified at scale
- Missing index recommendations
- Unsafe migration patterns
- Significant code quality issues (anti-patterns, poor structure)
- Type safety concerns (excessive `Any` or `any` usage)
- Missing error handling for critical paths
- N+1 query patterns without eager loading
- Inadequate test coverage
- Accessibility issues

### Block (🛑) when:
- Migration would lock tables at production scale
- **Alembic migration chain is invalid** (down_revision doesn't match current head - needs rebase)
- Critical N+1 or full table scan issues
- Security vulnerabilities identified
- Breaking changes to read path (98% traffic)
- Fundamentally flawed architecture that would require major rework
- Critical bugs that would cause data loss or corruption

## Example Usage

```
/review-pr 4881
/review-pr https://github.com/quay/quay/pull/4881
/review-pr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123
```

This will:
1. Fetch the PR details and diff
2. Categorize all changed files
3. Analyze database migrations for scale safety
4. **Validate Alembic migration chain** (prevent multiple heads from unrebased PRs)
5. Review query patterns for performance
6. Check API endpoints for efficiency
7. Evaluate code quality against senior engineer standards
8. Generate a comprehensive review report with verdict
