    This query is a bit complicated, so here's a breakdown of what it's doing:

    1. Select all users that are not organizations.
    2. Join the TeamMember table to get the team membership information.
    3. Join the Team table to get the team name.
    4. Join the RepositoryPermission table to get the repository permission information.
    5. Join the Repository table to get the repository name.
    6. Join the Role table to get the role name.
    7. Join the Organization table to get the organization name.
    8. Filter for teams that are defined in the organization.
    9. Filter out any users that are robots.
    10. Filter out any matches where the team role is member but there are no per-repository permission yet (because users in such teams effectively have no permissions on any repositories yet)
    11. Filter out any repositories that are marked for deletion.
    12. Order the results by username, team name, and repository name.

    The result of this query is a list of all permissions of users in the organization that are member of a team defined in this organization, and their per-repository permissions as a result of mapping the team role to the repositories, excluding any repositories that are marked for deletion and any record where the team role is member but there are no per-repository permissions yet.
